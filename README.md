Stochastic Lens Simulator Mk II by Gzrrplox
===========================================

4k intro for [Stream 2011](http://stream.mattcurrent.org/stream_eight/).

Mark II improves upon the [first version](https://github.com/gzrrplox/stochastic-lens-simulator) 
by adding a simple GLSL minifier and text rendering. Also depth of field effect is now in use.
Fisheye projection is slightly more apparent.
